/**
 * A utility class for managing available connection types to IOIO.
 * <p>
 * <b>For advanced usage only!</b>
 * <p>
 * This class facilitates dynamic linkage and instantiation of different IOIO
 * connection types. {@link IOIOConnectionBootstrap} classes enable creation of
 * {@link IOIOConnectionFactory} instances, from which concrete
 * {@link IOIOConnection}s are created. The binding to
 * {@link IOIOConnectionBootstrap} is dynamic, thus enabling linkage to succeed
 * with or without those bootstraps. Likewise, during runtime, the absence of
 * bootstraps is handled gracefully.
 * <p>
 * A typical usage will call {@link #addBootstraps(String[])} with a list of
 * class names to be sought from a static initializer block. It may then call
 * {@link #getBootstraps()} to obtain any bootstrap classes that are available
 * in runtime, in case the bootstrap classes themselves need some runtime
 * handling. Last, the {@link #getConnectionFactories()} will return a
 * collection of {@link IOIOConnectionFactory}, each representing one possible
 * communication channel to a IOIO.
