/**
 * Manages IOIO threads per connection.
 * <p>
 * This class will take care of creating a thread for each possible IOIO
 * connection, and cleaning up these threads. Client is responsible for providing the
 * actual threads, by implementing the IOIOConnectionThreadProvider interface.
 * <p>
 * Basic usage is:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Create a IOIOConnectionManager instance, pass a IOIOConnectionThreadProvider.</li>
 * <li>Call {@link #start()}. This will invoke {@link IOIOConnectionThreadProvider#createThreadFromFactory(IOIOConnectionFactory)}
 * for every possible connection (more precisely, for every IOIOConnectionFactory). Return null if you do not wish to create a thread for a certain connection type.</li>
 * <li>When done, call {@link #stop()}. This will call {@link Thread#abort()} for each running thread and then join them.</li>
 * </ul>
