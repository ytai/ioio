/**
 * An interface for controlling an SPI module, in SPI bus-master mode, enabling
 * communication with multiple SPI-enabled slave modules.
 * <p>
 * SPI is a common hardware communication protocol, enabling full-duplex,
 * synchronous point-to-multi-point data transfer. It requires MOSI, MISO and
 * CLK lines shared by all nodes, as well as a SS line per slave, connected
 * between this slave and a respective pin on the master. The MISO line should
 * operate in pull-up mode, using either the internal pull-up or an external
 * resistor. SpiMaster instances are obtained by calling
 * {@link IOIO#openSpiMaster(DigitalInput.Spec, DigitalOutput.Spec, DigitalOutput.Spec, DigitalOutput.Spec[], SpiMaster.Config)}.
 * <p>
 * The SPI protocol is comprised of simultaneous sending and receiving of data
 * between the bus master and a single slave. By the very nature of this
 * protocol, the amount of bytes sent is equal to the amount of bytes received.
 * However, by padding the sent data with garbage data, and by ignoring the
 * leading bytes of the received data arbitrarily-sized packets can be sent and
 * received.
 * <p>
 * A very common practice for SPI-based slave devices (although not always the
 * case), is to have a fixed request and response length and a fixed lag between
 * them, based on the request type. For example, an SPI-based sensor may define
 * the the protocol for obtaining its measured value is by sending a 2-byte
 * message, whereas the returned 3-byte value has its first byte overlapping the
 * second value of the response, as illustrated below:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Master: M1   M2   GG   GG
 * Slave:  GG   S1   S2   S3
 * </pre>
 * 
 * M1, M2: the master's request<br>
 * S1, S2, S3: the slave's response<br>
 * GG: garbage bytes used for padding.
 * <p>
 * The IOIO SPI interface supports such fixed length message protocols using a
 * single method, {@link #writeRead(int, byte[], int, int, byte[], int)}, which
 * gets the request data, and the lengths of the request, the response and the
 * total transaction bytes.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The instance is alive since its creation. If the connection with the IOIO
 * drops at any point, the instance transitions to a disconnected state, in
 * which every attempt to use it (except {@link #close()}) will throw a
 * {@link ConnectionLostException}. Whenever {@link #close()} is invoked the
 * instance may no longer be used. Any resources associated with it are freed
 * and can be reused.
 * <p>
 * Typical usage (single slave, as per the example above):
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * // MISO, MOSI, CLK, SS on pins 3, 4, 5, 6, respectively.
 * SpiMaster spi = ioio.openSpiMaster(3, 4, 5, 6, SpiMaster.Rate.RATE_125K);
 * final byte[] request = new byte[]{ 0x23, 0x45 };
 * final byte[] response = new byte[3];
 * spi.writeRead(request, 2, 4, response, 3);
 * ...
 * spi.close();  // free SPI module and pins
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * @see IOIO#openSpiMaster(DigitalInput.Spec, DigitalOutput.Spec,
 *      DigitalOutput.Spec, DigitalOutput.Spec[], SpiMaster.Config)
