/**
 * A pin used for PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) output.
 * <p>
 * A PWM pin produces a logic-level PWM signal. These signals are typically used
 * for simulating analog outputs for controlling the intensity of LEDs, the
 * rotation speed of motors, etc. They are also frequently used for controlling
 * hobby servo motors. PwmOutput instances are obtained by calling
 * {@link IOIO#openPwmOutput(ioio.lib.api.DigitalOutput.Spec, int)}.
 * <p>
 * When used for motors and LEDs, a frequency of several KHz is typically used,
 * where there is a trade-off between switching power-loses and smoothness of
 * operation. The pulse width is typically set by specifying the duty cycle,
 * with the {@link #setDutyCycle(float)} method. A duty cycle of 0 is "off", a
 * duty cycle of 1 is "on", and every intermediate value produces an
 * intermediate intensity. Please note that any devices consuming more than 20mA
 * of current (e.g. motors) should not by directly connected the the IOIO pins,
 * but rather through an amplification circuit suited for the specific load.
 * <p>
 * When used for hobby servos, the PWM signal is rather used for encoding of the
 * desired angle the motor should go to. By standard, a 100Hz signal is used and
 * the pulse width is varied between 1ms and 2ms (corresponding to both extremes
 * of the shaft angle), using {@link #setPulseWidth(int)}.
 * <p>
 * The instance is alive since its creation. If the connection with the IOIO
 * drops at any point, the instance transitions to a disconnected state, in
 * which every attempt to use the pin (except {@link #close()}) will throw a
 * {@link ConnectionLostException}. Whenever {@link #close()} is invoked the
 * instance may no longer be used. Any resources associated with it are freed
 * and can be reused.
 * <p>
 * Typical usage (fading LED):
 * 
 * <pre>
 * PwmOutput servo = ioio.openPwmOutput(12, 1000);  // LED anode on pin 12
 * ...
 * servo.setDutyCycle(0.0f);  // LED off
 * ... 
 * servo.setDutyCycle(0.5f);  // 50% intensity
 * ... 
 * servo.setDutyCycle(1.0f);  // 100% intensity
 * ... 
 * servo.close();  // pin 12 can now be used for something else.
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Typical usage (servo):
 * 
 * <pre>
 * PwmOutput servo = ioio.openPwmOutput(12, 100);
 * ...
 * servo.setPulseWidth(1000);  // 1000us = 1ms = one extreme
 * ... 
 * servo.setPulseWidth(1500);  // 1500us = 1.5ms = center
 * ... 
 * servo.setPulseWidth(2000);  // 2000us = 2ms = other extreme
 * ... 
 * servo.close();  // pin 12 can now be used for something else.
 * </pre>
 *
