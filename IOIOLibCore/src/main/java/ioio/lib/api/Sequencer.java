/**
 * A waveform sequencer.
 * <p>
 * The {@link Sequencer} interface enables generation of very precisely-timed digital waveforms,
 * primarily targeted for different kinds of actuators, such as different kinds of motors, solenoids
 * and LEDs. The output comprises one or more channels, each of which can have one of several
 * different types. The output channels type and their assignments to pins are determined when the
 * {@link Sequencer} instance is created and cannot be changed during its lifetime. A
 * {@link Sequencer} instance is obtained via {@link IOIO#openSequencer(ChannelConfig[])}.
 * <p>
 * Each channel is configured with one of the {@link ChannelConfig} subclasses. For example,
 * {@link ChannelCueBinary} specified a binary output, useful for controlling an LED or a solenoid.
 * This configuration includes, among other things, the pin specification for this channel. See the
 * individual subclasses documentation for more information.
 * <p>
 * Once instantiated, the {@link Sequencer} gets fed with a stream of &lt;cue, duration&gt; pairs. A
 * cue is a set of instructions telling each of the channels what to do, or more precisely, one
 * {@link ChannelCue} per channel. The concrete type of the {@link ChannelCue} depends on the
 * channel type, for example, a channel that has been configured with {@link ChannelConfigBinary},
 * expects a {@link ChannelCueBinary} for its cue. In this example, the cue will specify whether
 * this output should be high or low. When a cue is combined with a duration, it has the semantics
 * of "for this much time, generate this waveform". A stream of such pairs can represent a complex
 * multi-channel waveform.
 * <p>
 * The above &lt;cue, duration&gt; pairs are pushed into the {@link Sequencer} via the
 * {@link #push(ChannelCue[], int)} method. They will not yet be executed, but rather queue up.
 * There is a limited number of cues that can be queued. Attempting to push more will block until a
 * cue has been executed. In order to avoid blocking (especially during the initial fill of the
 * queue - see below), the {@link #available()} method returns the number of pushes that can be done
 * without blocking. Once a few of them have been queued up, execution may start by calling
 * {@link #start()} . During execution, more cues can be pushed, and ideally fast enough so that
 * execution never needs to stall. During execution, {@link #pause()} will suspend execution as soon
 * as the currently executed cue is done, without clearing the queue of pending cues. Operation can
 * then be resumed by calling {@link #start()} again. Calling {@link #stop()} will immediately stop
 * execution and clear the queue.
 *
 * <h4>Pre-fill</h4>
 * In order to avoid stalls immediately after {@link #start()}, it is recommended to pre-fill the
 * cue FIFO priorly. The recommended sequence of operations is:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * // Open the sequencer.
 * Sequencer s = ioio_.openSequencer(...);
 * // At this point, the FIFO might still be at zero capacity, wait until opening is complete.
 * s.waitEventType(Sequencer.Event.Type.STOPPED);
 * // Now our FIFO is empty and at full capacity. Fill it entirely.
 * while (s.available() > 0) {
 *   s.push(...);
 * }
 * // Now we can start!
 * s.start();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h4>Manual Operation</h4>
 * In some cases it is useful to be able to execute some cues while the {@link Sequencer} is paused
 * or stopped without having to clear the queue. For this purpose, the
 * {@link #manualStart(ChannelCue[])} command can be used. Calling it will immediately begin
 * execution of a given cue, without changing the queue previously given. Unlike cues scheduled via
 * {@link #push(ChannelCue[], int)}, these cues have no duration, and will keep executing until
 * {@link #manualStop()} is called. After that, normal operation can be resumed by calling
 * {@link #start()} again.
 *
 * <h4>States</h4>
 * This table summarizes the different states the {@link Sequencer} can be in, and the methods which
 * can be called to change it:
 * <table border="1">
 * <tr>
 * <th>Current State</th>
 * <th>Method</th>
 * <th>Next State</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td rowspan="4">Idle</td>
 * <td>{@link #start()}</td>
 * <td>Running</td>
 * </tr>

 * <td>Manual (new cue)</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <h4>Clocking</h4>
 * All the timing information provided to a single channel is based on a clock which implies a
 * time-base. For some channel types, the clock is determined upon instantiation; for others it can
 * be set on a per-cue basis. Once a clock rate is set, all timing values used for that channel are
 * in units of this time-base. Using a faster clock rate enables faster waveforms to be generated as
 * well as have better timing resolution for everything. However, since most timing values used in
 * this API have a limited range, using a faster clock would also limit the maximum duration of some
 * signals. As a rule of thumb, choosing the highest possible clock rate that can satisfy the
 * duration requirements is the right choice.
 *
 * <h4>Stalls</h4>
 * It is possible that the client does not push cues fast enough to keep up with execution. In that
 * case, the queue will drain and execution will stall. All channel types have well-defined
 * behaviors in case of a stall, for example, a binary channel allows the user to explicitly
 * determine whether it should be go back to its initial value or retain the current value when
 * stalled. Once stalled, as soon as a new cue gets pushed, operation will resume immediately
 * without having to call {@link #start()}.
 *
 * <h4>Keeping track of execution</h4>
 * Since execution of queued events is asynchronous, it is sometimes required to track their
 * execution progress, for example, for keeping a user interface synchronized with the actual state
 * of a multi-axis machine.
 * <p>
 * The client can poll for the last event that occured via {@link #getLastEvent()}, or block until
 * the next one arrives using {@link #waitEvent()}. The latter features a limited-size queue, so
 * events are not lost as long as the client reads continuously. The queue is initially 32-events
 * long, but could be changed using {@link #setEventQueueSize(int)}. The sequencer will report the
 * following kinds of events, via the {@link Event} type:
 * <dl>
 * <dt>STOPPED</dt>
 * <dd>The sequencer has been stopped (and the cue FIFO is now empty). This is also the event that
 * is returned when calling {@link #getLastEvent()} before any event has arrived.</dd>
 * <dt>CUE_STARTED</dt>
 * <dd>A new cue has just started execution.</dd>
 * <dt>PAUSED</dt>
 * <dd>A cue has just finished execution and progress has been paused as result of an explicit pause
 * request.</dd>
 * <dt>STALLED</dt>
 * <dd>A cue has just finished execution and progress has been paused as result of the queue running
 * empty. In this case, the state of the sequencer does not change (i.e. it is still Running), and
 * pushing addition events will immediately resume execution.</dd>
 * <dt>CLOSED</dt>
 * <dd>The sequencer has been closed. This is mostly intended for gracefully exiting a thread which
 * is constantly blocking on {@link #waitEvent()}</dd>
 * </dl>
 * <p>
 * Execution progress can be tracked at any time by examining the {@link Event#numCuesStarted}
 * field, which will increment every time actual execution of a cue has begun.
 * It will be reset back to 0 following a {@link #stop()}.

	 * little more involved from the user's perspective, since delicate timing considerations need
	 * to be taken into account.
	 * <p>
	 * The number of steps within a given cue period is given by floor(Tc / Ts), where Tc is the cue
	 * duration and Ts is the step period duration. Each pulse is center-aligned within its period.
	 * In order to maintain a deterministic result, the user must guarantee that no pulse falls
	 * within the last 6 microseconds of the cue period (this effectively limits the maximum pulse
	 * rate to 80[kHz], considering the the pulse itself must be at least 1/8[us] wide, and that the
	 * rising edge of the pulse is center-aligned). Thus, it is possible that due to precision
	 * limitations, in an arbitrarily long period it will be impossible to generate the exact number
	 * of desired pulses. Likewise, a very low pulse rate (high pulse duration) may be outside of
	 * the permitted range or will result in having to use a slower time-base. The solution to both
	 * problems is splitting a single cue into two or more cues of shorted durations, until
	 * eventually the precision is sufficient (this always converges, since eventually we can always
	 * go to arbitrarily short cue durations, so that each one contains either zero or one steps.
	 * <p>
	 * A steps channel allows determining the clock rate on a per-cue basis. This often allows
	 * avoiding having to split cues, thus resulting in a less total cues and more efficient
	 * execution. The rule for choosing the correct clock is to always use the highest rate that
	 * will cause the resulting period to be <= 2^16. In other words, choose the highest available
	 * clock which is less than or equal to (2^16 / Tp) or (2^16 * Fp), where Tp is the desired
	 * period in seconds, or Fp is the desired frequency in Hz. For example, if we want to generate
	 * pulses at 51Hz, 65536 * Fp = 3.34MHz, so we should use the 2MHz clock, and the period value
