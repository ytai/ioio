/**
 * An interface for controlling a TWI module, in TWI bus-master mode, enabling
 * communication with multiple TWI-enabled slave modules.
 * <p>
 * TWI (Two-Wire Interface) is a common hardware communication protocol,
 * enabling half-duplex, synchronous point-to-multi-point data transfer. It
 * requires a physical connection of two lines (SDA, SCL) shared by all the bus
 * nodes, where the SDA is open-drain and externally pulled-up. TwiMaster
 * instances are obtained by calling
 * {@link IOIO#openTwiMaster(int, ioio.lib.api.TwiMaster.Rate, boolean)}.
 * <p>
 * TWI is the generic name for the specific I2C and SMBus protocols, differing
 * mostly by the voltage levels they require. This module supports both.
 * <p>
 * A TWI transaction is comprised of optional sending of a data buffer from the
 * master to a single slave, followed by an optional reception of a data buffer
 * from that slave. Slaves are designated by addresses, which may be 7-bit
 * (common) or 10-bit (less common). TWI transactions may fail, as a result of
 * the slave not responding or as result of the slave NACK'ing the request. Such
 * a transaction is executed using the
 * {@link #writeRead(int, boolean, byte[], int, byte[], int)} method.
 * <p>
 * The instance is alive since its creation. If the connection with the IOIO
 * drops at any point, the instance transitions to a disconnected state, in
 * <p>
 * The instance is alive since its creation. If the connection with the IOIO
 * drops at any point, the instance transitions to a disconnected state, in
 * which every attempt to use it (except {@link #close()}) will throw a
 * {@link ConnectionLostException}. Whenever {@link #close()} is invoked the
 * instance may no longer be used. Any resources associated with it are freed
 * and can be reused.
 * <p>
 * Typical usage:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * // Uses the SDA1/SCL1 pins, I2C volatege levels at 100KHz. 
 * TwiMaster twi = ioio.openTwiMaster(1, TwiMaster.RATE_100KHz, false);
 * final byte[] request = new byte[]{ 0x23, 0x45 };
 * final byte[] response = new byte[3];
 * if (twi.writeRead(0x19, false, request, 2, response, 3)) {
 *   // response is valid
 *   ...
 * } else {
 *   // handle error
 * }
 * twi.close();  // free TWI module and pins
 * }</pre>
