/**
 * A pin used for digital output.
 * <p>
 * A digital input pin can be used to generate logic-level signals.
 * DigitalOutput instances are obtained by calling
 * {@link IOIO#openDigitalOutput(DigitalOutput.Spec, boolean)}.
 * <p>
 * The value of the pin is set by calling {@link #write(boolean)}.
 * <p>
 * The instance is alive since its creation. If the connection with the IOIO
 * drops at any point, the instance transitions to a disconnected state, in
 * which every attempt to use the pin (except {@link #close()}) will throw a
 * {@link ConnectionLostException}. Whenever {@link #close()} is invoked the
 * instance may no longer be used. Any resources associated with it are freed
 * and can be reused.
 * <p>
 * Typical usage:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * DigitalOutput led = ioio.openDigitalOutput(2);  // LED anode on pin 2.
 * led.write(true);  // turn LED on.
 * ...
 * led.close();  // pin 2 can now be used for something else.
 * </pre>
