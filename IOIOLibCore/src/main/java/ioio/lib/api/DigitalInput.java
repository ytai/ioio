/**
 * A pin used for digital input.
 * <p>
 * A digital input pin can be used to read logic-level signals. DigitalInput
 * instances are obtained by calling {@link IOIO#openDigitalInput(DigitalInput.Spec)}.
 * <p>
 * The value of the pin is obtained by calling {@link #read()}. It is also
 * possible for the client to block until a certain level is sensed, by using
 * {@link #waitForValue(boolean)}.
 * <p>
 * The instance is alive since its creation. The first {@link #read()} call
 * block for a few milliseconds until the initial value is updated. If the
 * connection with the IOIO drops at any point, the instance transitions to a
 * disconnected state, in which every attempt to use the pin (except
 * {@link #close()}) will throw a {@link ConnectionLostException}. Whenever
 * {@link #close()} is invoked the instance may no longer be used. Any resources
 * associated with it are freed and can be reused.
 * <p>
 * Typical usage:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * DigitalInput button = ioio.openDigitalInput(10);  // used an external pull-up
 * button.waitForValue(false);  // wait for press
 * ...
 * button.close();  // pin 10 can now be used for something else.
 * </pre>
