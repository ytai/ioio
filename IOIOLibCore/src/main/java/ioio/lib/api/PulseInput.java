/**
 * An interface for pulse width and frequency measurements of digital signals.
 * <p>
 * PulseInput (commonly known as "input capture") is a versatile module which enables extraction of
 * various timing information from a digital signal. There are two main use cases: pulse duration
 * measurement and frequency measurement. In pulse width measurement we measure the duration of a
 * positive ("high") or negative ("low") pulse, i.e. the elapsed time between a rise and a fall or
 * vice versa. This mode is useful, for example, for decoding a PWM signal or measuring the delay of
 * a sonar return signal. In frequency measurement we measure the duration between a rising edge to
 * the following rising edge. This gives us a momentary reading of a signal's frequency or period.
 * This is commonly used, for example, in conjunction with an optical or magnetic sensor for
 * measuring a turning shaft's speed.
 * <p>
 * {@link PulseInput} instances are obtained by calling
 * {@link IOIO#openPulseInput(ioio.lib.api.DigitalInput.Spec, ioio.lib.api.PulseInput.ClockRate, ioio.lib.api.PulseInput.PulseMode, boolean)}
 * . Once created, the client would typically use {@link #getDuration()} for getting the most recent
 * duration reading (either pulse width or period), or {@link #getFrequency()} for getting the most
 * recent frequency reading (available only in frequency mode).
 * <p>
 * When creating the instance, some important configuration decisions have to be made: the precision
 * (single or double), the clock rate and the mode of operation. Modes are straightforward:
 * {@link PulseMode#POSITIVE} is used for measuring a positive pulse, {@link PulseMode#NEGATIVE} a
 * negative pulse, and {@link PulseMode#FREQ} / {@link PulseMode#FREQ_SCALE_4} /
 * {@link PulseMode#FREQ_SCALE_16} are used for measuring frequency. The difference between the
 * three scaling modes is that without scaling, the frequency is determined by measurement of a
 * single (rising-edge-to-rising-edge) period. In x4 scaling, 4 consecutive periods are measured and
 * the time is divided by 4, providing some smoothing as well as better resolution. Similarly for
 * x16 scaling. Note that scaling affects the range of signals to be measured, as discussed below.
 * <p>
 * The choice of single vs. double-precision is important to understand: IOIO internally uses either
 * 16-bit counters or 32-bit counters for the timing. 16- counters force us to either limit the
 * maximum duration (and the minimum frequency) or compromise accuracy as compared to 32-bit
 * counters. However, if you need many concurrent pulse measurements in your application, you may
 * have no choice but to use single-precision.
 * <p>
 * The clock rate selection is important (and even critical when working in single-precision) and
 * requires the user to make some assumptions about the nature of the measured signal. The higher
 * the clock rate, the more precise the measurement, but the longest pulse that can be measured
 * decreases (or lowest frequency that can be measured increases). Using the scaling option when
 * operating in frequency mode also affects these sizes. combinations. It is always recommended to
 * choose the most precise mode, which exceeds the maximum expected pulse width (or inverse
 * frequency). If a pulse is received whom duration exceeds the longest allowed pulse, it will be
 * "folded" into the valid range and product garbage readings.
 * <p>
 * The following table (sorted by longest pulse) summarizes all possible clock / mode combinations.
 * The table applies for <b>single-precision</b> operation. For double-precision, simply multiply
 * the longest pulse by 65536 and divide the lowest frequency by the same amount. Interestingly, the
 * number written in [ms] units in the longest pulse column, roughly corresponds to the same number
 * in minutes when working with double precsion, since 1[min] = 60000[ms].

 * <p>
 * In some applications it is desirable to measure every incoming pulse rather than repetitively
 * query the result of the last measurement. For that purpose the {@link #getDurationBuffered()}
 * method exists: every incoming pulse width is pushed into a small internal queue from which it can
 * be read. The client waits for data to be available, then reads it and data that comes in in the
 * meanwhile is stored. The queue has limited size, so it is important to read quickly if no pulses
 * are to be lost. Note that once a pulse is detected, the next one must have its leading edge at
 * least 5ms after the leading edge of the current one, or else it will be skipped. This throttling
 * has been introduced on purpose, in order to prevent saturation the communication channel when the
 * input signal is very high frequency. Effectively, this means that the maximum sample rate is
 * 200Hz. This rate has been chosen as it enables measuring R/C servo signals without missing
 * pulses.
 * <p>
 * In other circumstances, the client may want to guarantee that a certain sample has been observed
 * strictly <i>after</i> certain other data has been received from the IOIO. For that purpose the
 * {@link #getDurationSync()} and {@link #getFrequencySync()} variants exist. They are can be used
 * to impose strict ordering between samples captured by different inputs, or relative to setting of
 * outputs, using {@link IOIO#sync()}.
 * <p>
 * Typical usage (servo signal pulse width measurement):
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * // Open pulse input at 16MHz, double-precision
 * PulseInput in = ioio.openPulseInput(3, PulseMode.POSITIVE);
 * ...
 * float widthSec = in.getDuration();
 * OR:
 * float widthSec = in.getDurationBuffered();
 * ...
 * in.close();  // pin 3 can now be used for something else.
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Typical usage (frequency measurement):
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * // Signal is known to be slightly over 150Hz. Single precision can be used.
 * PulseInput in = ioio.openPulseInput(3,
 *                                     ClockRate.RATE_2MHz,
 *                                     PulseMode.FREQ_SCALE_4,
 *                                     false);
 * ...
 * float freqHz = in.getFrequency();
 * ...
 * in.close();  // pin 3 can now be used for something else.
 * }
 * </pre>
