/**
 * A pin used for analog input.
 * <p>
 * An analog input pin can be used to measure voltage. AnalogInput instances are obtained by calling
 * {@link IOIO#openAnalogInput(int)}.
 * <p>
 * Floating-point values scaled from 0 to 1 can be obtained by calling {@link #read()}. Absolute
 * voltage levels can be obtained by calling {@link #getVoltage()}.
 * <p>
 * The instance is alive since its creation. The first {@link #read()} call block for a few
 * milliseconds until the initial value is updated. If the connection with the IOIO drops at any
 * point, the instance transitions to a disconnected state, in which every attempt to use the pin
 * (except {@link #close()}) will throw a {@link ConnectionLostException}. Whenever {@link #close()}
 * is invoked the instance may no longer be used. Any resources associated with it are freed and can
 * be reused.
 * <p>
 * Typical usage:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * AnalogInput potentiometer = ioio.openAnalogInput(40);
 * float value = potentiometer.read();
 * ...
 * potentiometer.close();  // pin 40 can now be used for something else.
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * An alternate usage allows reading periodically sampled data without missing samples. The
 * {@link #setBuffer(int)} method must first be called, for setting up an internal buffer for
 * queuing samples. Then, samples can be obtained by calling {@link #readBuffered()} or
 * {@link #getVoltageBuffered()}. These methods will block until a sample is available. If this is
 * undesirable, the {@link #available()} method can be called first to check how many samples are
 * ready in the buffer. In case the buffer overflows, as result of the client not reading fast
 * enough, old samples will be dropped, and the client can check {@link #getOverflowCount()} to
 * determine how many samples have been lost. The sample rate used for capturing samples can be
 * obtained by calling {@link #getSampleRate()}.
 * <p>
 * The non-buffered versions of the read methods will still behave normally when buffering is
 * enabled. The {@link #read()} and {@link #getVoltage()} methods will always return the most recent
 * value, regardless of the buffer state.
 * <p>
 * Typical usage:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * AnalogInput potentiometer = ioio.openAnalogInput(40);
 * potentiometer.setBuffer(256);
 * for (int i = 0; i < 1024; ++i) {
 *   // next line will block until at least one sample is available
 *   float sample = potentiometer.readBuffered();
 *   ...
 * }
 * ...
 * potentiometer.close();  // pin 40 can now be used for something else.
 * }</pre>
