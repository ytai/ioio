/**
 * An interface for controlling an ICSP channel, enabling Flash programming of
 * an external PIC MCU, and in particular, another IOIO board.
 * <p>
 * ICSP (In-Circuit Serial Programming) is a protocol intended for programming
 * of PIC MCUs. It is a serial protocol over three wires: PGC (clock), PGD
 * (data) and MCLR (reset), where PGC and MCLR are controlled by the master and
 * PGD is shared by the master and slave, depending on the transaction state.
 * IcspMaster instances are obtained by calling {@link IOIO#openIcspMaster()}.
 * <p>
 * This interface is very low level: it allows direct access to the atomic
 * operations of the ICSP protocol:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Enter / exit programming mode ( {@link #enterProgramming()} /
 * {@link #exitProgramming()}, respectively).</li>
 * <li>Executing a single instruction on the slave MCU (
 * {@link #executeInstruction(int)}).</li>
 * <li>Reading the value of the VISI register of the slave MCU into a read queue
 * ({@link #readVisi()}).</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The ICSP module uses fixed pins for its lines. See the user guide for details
 * for your specific board. ICSP is a special feature, introduced for the
 * purpose of programming a IOIO board with another IOIO board. It does not
 * necessarily play nicely when used concurrently with other features, in the
 * sense that it may introduce latencies in other modules. It is thus
 * recommended not to use ICSP in conjunction with latency-sensitive features.
 * <p>
 * The instance is alive since its creation. If the connection with the IOIO
 * drops at any point, the instance transitions to a disconnected state, in
 * which every attempt to use it (except {@link #close()}) will throw a
 * {@link ConnectionLostException}. Whenever {@link #close()} is invoked the
 * instance may no longer be used. Any resources associated with it are freed
 * and can be reused.
 * <p>
 * Typical usage:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * IcspMaster icsp = ioio.openIcspMaster();
 * icsp.enterProgramming();
 * icsp.executeInstruction(0x212340);  // mov #0x1234, w0
 * icsp.executeInstruction(0x883C20);  // mov w0, 0x784 (VISI)
 * icsp.executeInstruction(0x000000);  // nop
 * icsp.readVisi();
 * int visi = icsp.waitVisiResult();   // should read 0x1234
 * icsp.exitProgramming();
 * icsp.close();                       // free ICSP module and pins
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * @see IOIO#openIcspMaster()
