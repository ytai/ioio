/**
 * An interface for controlling a UART module.
 * <p>
 * UART is a very common hardware communication protocol, enabling full- duplex,
 * asynchronous point-to-point data transfer. It typically serves for opening
 * consoles or as a basis for higher-level protocols, such as MIDI, RS-232 and
 * RS-485. Uart instances are obtained by calling
 * {@link IOIO#openUart(DigitalInput.Spec, DigitalOutput.Spec, int, Uart.Parity, Uart.StopBits)}.
 * <p>
 * The UART protocol is completely symmetric - there is no "master" and "slave"
 * at this layer. Each end may send any number of bytes at arbitrary times,
 * making it very useful for terminals and terminal-controllable devices.
 * <p>
 * Working with UART is very intuitive - it just provides a standard InputStream
 * and/or OutputStream. Optionally, one could create a read-only or write-only
 * UART instances, by passing null (or INVALID_PIN) for either TX or RX pins.
 * <p>
 * The instance is alive since its creation. If the connection with the IOIO
 * drops at any point, the instance transitions to a disconnected state, which
 * every attempt to use it (except {@link #close()}) will throw a
 * {@link ConnectionLostException}. Whenever {@link #close()} is invoked the
 * instance may no longer be used. Any resources associated with it are freed
 * and can be reused.
 * <p>
 * Typical usage:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Uart uart = ioio.openUart(3, 4, 19200, Parity.NONE, StopBits.ONE);
 * InputStream in = uart.getInputStream();
 * OutputStream out = uart.getOutputStream();
 * out.write(new String("Hello").getBytes());
 * int i = in.read();  // blocking
 * ...
 * uart.close();  // free UART module and pins
 * </pre>
 * 
 * @see IOIO#openUart(DigitalInput.Spec, DigitalOutput.Spec, int, Uart.Parity,
 *      Uart.StopBits)
