/**
 * An extension of {@link IOIOConnectionManager} for the Android environment.
 * <p>
 * <i><b>Note</b>: This utility is not typically intended for use by end-users.
 * See {@link IOIOActivity} and {@link IOIOSerive} for high-level utilities,
 * which facilitate the creation of Android-based applications.</i>
 * <p>
 * The reason for this extension is that some Android-related connections (e.g.
 * OpenAccessory) are tightly coupled with the Android Activity life-cycle and
 * require to be notified when certain life-cycle events occur.
 * <p>
 * Use this class similarly to {@link IOIOConnectionManager}, but in addition
 * call {@link #create()}, {@link #destroy()}, {@link #start()}, {@link #stop()}
 * and {@link #restart()} from your activity's {@code onCreate()},
 * {@code onDestroy()}, {@code onStart()}, {@code onStop()} and
 * {@code onRestart()}, respectively.
