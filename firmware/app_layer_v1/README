IOIO Application Layer Firmware
===============================

Introduction
------------
The IOIO application layer firmware provides the implementation of the IOIO
application layer protocol, which enables control of the IOIO's on-board
peripherals over a serial connection, which is established by the lower layers
of the IOIO firmware stack.

Code Organization
-----------------
The file main.c contains the main function and the main state machine, which
tries to establish an ADB channel with TCP port 4545 of the ADB device.
Whenever a connection is established the protocol module will be initialized and
incoming messages will be passed to it for handling. Whenever the connection
drops - the entire protocol and peripheral state will be reset immediately.

The protocol module (protocol.{h,c}) handles parsing of incoming protocol
messages, dispatching them to the appropriate function modules. It also handles
sending of outgoing protocol messages, providing convenience buffering of
outgoing data, so that all other modules do not need to worry about whether the
outgoing channel is currently busy, etc.

Then there are function-specific modules:
features.{h,c} has some generic functions (resets, pin modes)
adc.{h,c} implements the analog input functions.
pwm.{h,c} implements PWM output.
digital.{h,c} implements digital input and output.

The module logging.{h,c} facilitates convenience logging functions through UART1
at 38400 baud on pin 4. It is switched on using the ENABLE_LOGGING macro, which
should be off for production.

The module pins.{h,c} contains all the information on mapping pin numbers as
appear on the board to/from respective pin-related registers in the MCU.

The file board.h contains information on specific boards.

Interrupts and Priorities
-------------------------
Many of the modules facilitate interrupts. For that purpose it is important to
protect resources shared between different priority levels.
This is done by assigning to every resource a "resource priority level".
This resource should never be accessed from an interrupt with priority greater
than the resource priority level, and whenever it is accessed from an interrupt
with lower priority (or from non-interrupt context), the priority should be
raised accordingly.

Resource priority assignment:
1 - writing to outgoing ADB channel
4 - writing to UART, SPI buffers, setting a digital output pin level

Aside from that, interrupt priorities are used as follows:
5 - USB
6 - input capture pulse for changing polarity between leading and trailing edge.
7 - ADC for reading converted value from buffer before another one comes in.
