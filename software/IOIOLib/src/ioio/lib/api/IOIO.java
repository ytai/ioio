/**
 * This interface provides control over all the IOIO board functions.
 * <p>
 * An instance of this interface is typically obtained by using the
 * {@link IOIOFactory} class. Initially, a connection should be established, by
 * calling {@link #waitForConnect()}. This method will block until the board is
 * connected an a connection has been established.
 * <p>
 * During the connection process, this library verifies that the IOIO firmware
 * is compatible with the required version. If not, {@link #waitForConnect()}
 * will throw a {@link IncompatibilityException}, putting the {@link IOIO}
 * instance in a "zombie" state: nothing could be done with it except calling
 * {@link #disconnect()}, or waiting for the physical connection to drop via
 * {@link #waitForDisconnect()}.
 * <p>
 * As soon as a connection is established, the IOIO can be used, typically, by
 * calling the openXXX() functions to obtain additional interfaces for
 * controlling specific function of the board.
 * <p>
 * Whenever a connection is lost as a result of physically disconnecting the
 * board or as a result of calling {@link #disconnect()}, this instance and all
 * the interfaces obtained from it become invalid, and will throw a
 * {@link ConnectionLostException} on every operation. Once the connection is
 * lost, those instances cannot be recycled, but rather it is required to create
 * new ones and wait for a connection again.
 * <p>
 * Initially all pins are tri-stated (floating), and all functions are disabled.
 * Whenever a connection is lost or dropped, the board will immediately return
 * to the this initial state.
 * <p>
 * Typical usage:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * IOIO ioio = IOIOFactory.create();
 * try {
 *   ioio.waitForConnect();
 *   DigitalOutput out = ioio.openDigitalOutput(10);
 *   out.write(true);
 *   ...
 * } catch (ConnectionLostException e) {
 * } catch (Exception e) {
 *   ioio.disconnect();
 * } finally {
 *   ioio.waitForDisconnect();
