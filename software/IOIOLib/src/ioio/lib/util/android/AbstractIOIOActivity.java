/**
 * A convenience class for easy creation of IOIO-based applications.
 * 
 * It is used by creating a concrete Activity in your application, which extends
 * this class. This class then takes care of proper creation and abortion of the
 * IOIO connection and of a dedicated thread for IOIO communication.
 * 
 * In the basic usage the client should extend this class and implement
 * {@link #createIOIOThread()}, which should return an implementation of the
 * {@link IOIOThread} abstract class. In this implementation, the client
 * implements the {@link IOIOThread#setup()} method, which gets called as soon
 * as communication with the IOIO is established, and the
 * {@link IOIOThread #loop()} method, which gets called repetitively as long as
 * the IOIO is connected. Both methods should access the
 * {@link IOIOThread#ioio_} field for controlling the IOIO.
 * 
 * In addition, the {@link IOIOThread#disconnected()} method may be overridden
 * in order to execute logic as soon as a disconnection occurs for whichever
 * reason. The {@link IOIOThread#incompatible()} method may be overridden in
 * order to take action in case where a IOIO whose firmware is incompatible with
 * the IOIOLib version that application is built with.
 * 
 * In a more advanced use case, more than one IOIO is available. In this case, a
 * thread will be created for each IOIO, whose semantics are as defined above.
 * If the client needs to be able to distinguish between them, it is possible to
 * override {@link #createIOIOThread(String, Object)} instead of
 * {@link #createIOIOThread()}. The first argument provided will contain the
 * connection class name, such as ioio.lib.impl.SocketIOIOConnection for a
 * connection established over a TCP socket (which is used over ADB). The second
 * argument will contain information specific to the connection type. For
 * example, in the case of SocketIOIOConnection, the second argument will
 * contain an {@link Integer} representing the local port number.
