  * linux-i386 and linux-x86_64 using CentOS 5.2 and GCC 4.1.2
  * win-x86, win-x64, and win-ia64 builds using MSCV 2008
  * CVS snapshot of RXTX-2.2 from 12/07/2008
  * Please see BuildInfo.txt for more information about the
    particular build you downloaded
  * All windows builds crash the JVM if a COM port becomes
    unavailable.  For example, if using a USB-to-serial port
    cable and you pull it out while your app is connected to the
    port.  The linux version throws an exception in this scenario.
    Please note that even when compiled using mingw vs. MSVC, the
