/**
 * A helper class for creating different kinds of IOIO based applications on
 * Android.
 * <p>
 * <i><b>Note</b>: Consider using {@link IOIOActivity} or {@link IOIOService}
 * for easy creation of IOIO activities and services. This class is intended for
 * more advanced use-cases not covered by them.</i>
 * <p>
 * This class implements a common life-cycle for Android applications
 * interacting with IOIO devices. Usage is as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Create an instance of {@link IOIOAndroidApplicationHelper}, passing a
 * {@link IOIOLooperProvider} and a {@link ContextWrapper} to the constructor.</li>
 * <li>Call {@link #create()}, {@link #destroy()}, {@link #start()},
 * {@link #stop()} and {@link #restart()} from the respective Android life-cycle
 * event methods.</li>
 * <li>{@link #start()} will trigger callback of
 * {@link IOIOLooperProvider#createIOIOLooper(String, Object)} for every
 * possible IOIO connection and create a new thread for interacting with this
 * IOIO, through the created {@link IOIOLooper}.</li>
 * <li>{@link #stop()} will make sure proper cleanup and disconnection is done.</li>
 * </ul>
